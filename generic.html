								<h3>It all started at the top of tunnel 1 in the Hollywood Pantages Theatre</h3>
								<p>
									Neither of us knew it then, but our lives would change forever that October day in 2019 when we first officially met. 
									It was just a seemingly normal conversation, but it, no doubt left an impression that would last over the next several months. 
									Eventually in February of 2020, we started talking more and more and finally went on our first ‘hangout’ at the Arclight movie theater on Sunset. 
									The ‘hangout’ started when Eliza wanted to order a drink she had heard about, ironically called ‘The Eliza’. 
									Shortly after ordering the drink however Eliza managed to ‘break the ice’ by literally knocking over the drink, breaking the glass. 
									Eliza was of course mortified, but Kevin didn’t mind as it made both of us realize that we cared enough to be nervous about the ‘hangout’. 
									We watched the movie, then decided to chat more at a Starbucks nearby. It was here where the spark really started as we talked about everything under the sun (or the moon in our case as it was well into the night). 
									Before the ‘hangout’ started, Eliza had mentioned that she had a party to go to shortly after the movie, so after the Starbucks conversation Kevin asked “Do you need to catch the party?” 
									Eliza paused and much to Kevin’s delight said “No I don’t think I want to go.”
								</p>

								<p>
									It was the beginning of several dates until we made our relationship official on March 3rd, 2020. 
									Little did we know, this was just before a global pandemic that would turn the world upside-down, including ours. 
									But it allowed us to spend even more time with each other throughout 2020, just talking, dreaming, and learning more and more about each other. 
									Most would consider 2020 one of the worst years of their lives, but we will always remember it as the start of the best thing of our lives.
								</p>

								<p>
									In the beginning of 2021 we decided to move to Georgia from California and got our first apartment together. 
									While the apartment was certainly less that what we had hoped it would be, we were lucky enough to purchase a condo and move in the fall of 2021, 
									where we now live. We are still dreaming, learning, striving, and reaching for our goals each and every day, always as a team to this day. 
								</p>

								<p>
									We’d like to thank everyone who’s impacted our lives and made us the people we are today. Without your love and friendship, 
									this special day would have never been possible. We hope each and every one of you enjoy this special day and celebrate it along side us. 
									We are truly blessed to have you join us!
								</p>
